<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Please do read the <strong>debriefing</strong> below, which reveals any deceptions that occurred and explains why deception was necessary.<br />
<br />
In this study, you were exposed to one of four tailored messages created while&amp;nbsp;accounting for your scores of personality and political leaning. These tailored messages represented fictitious information, and were in no way produced by the EU parliamentary groups. For your information, this research does not endorse the parties displayed. To measure the impact of online psychometric microtargeting on attitudinal and behavioural outcomes, it was necessary to create manipulated materials such as the stimuli (Facebook posts) shown.<br />
<br />
